"bill collector's at my door
what can you do for me?
hey
no romance without finance
no romance without finance
boy, nothin' in life is free
that's why i'm askin' you what can you do for me
i've got responsibilities
so i'm lookin' for a man whose got money in his hands
'cause nothin' from nothin' leaves nothin'
you got to have somethin' if you wanna be with me
oh, life is too serious, love's too mysterious
a fly girl like me needs security
'cause ain't nothin' goin' on but the rent
you got to have a j-o-b if you wanna be with me
ain't nothin' goin' on but the rent
you got to have a j-o-b if you wanna be with me
no romance without finance
i said no romance without finance
boy, your silky ways are sweet
but we're only wastin' time if your pockets are empty
i've got lots of love to give
but i will have to avoid you if you're unemployed
'cause nothin' from nothin' leaves nothin'
you got to have somethin' if you wanna be with me
oh, life is too serious, love's too mysterious
a fly girl like me needs security
'cause ain't nothin' goin' on but the rent
you got to have a j-o-b if you wanna be with me
ain't nothin' goin' on but the rent
you got to have a j-o-b if you wanna be with me
no romance without finance
i said no romance without finance
no romance without finance
i said no romance without finance
oh, you look good to me
your silky words are sweet
but your pockets sure look empty
ain't nothin' goin' on but the rent
