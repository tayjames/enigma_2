# enigma.rb

[x] Enigma Class with encrypt and decrypt methods successfully implemented. Encrypt/decrypt command line interfaces successfully implemented. (3)

[x] Project is broken into logical components consisting of at least 4 classes that have single responsibilities. No more than 2 methods are longer than 7 lines. No class is longer than 100 lines. While there may be 1 or 2 lapses, variable and method names clearly communicate purpose. (3)

[x] Every method is tested at both the unit and integration level. git history demonstrates students are writing tests before implementation code. Test coverage metrics show coverage at 99% or greater. (3)

[] At least 30 commits. At least 10 pull requests. No more than 3 commits include multiple pieces of functionality.
    I know that I have 30+ commits but I know that my pull requests are a grey area for my project. I will say that although what's going on with git is my fault, I did make 13 different branches for which I would have at least made 10 pull requests for. I understand if I get marked down in this area, and I'm willing to accept that!
